<!-- Double equal sign "==" compares values of what's on its left side and right side, Triple equal sign "===" compares values and type of what's on its left side and right side. prompt function receives a sting value and so the type of the numSblings variable was initially a strings (we can use typeof command to verify that) numSblings needed to be converted into a number for the "===" to work as it compares the type as well and for that we used the Number() method -->
